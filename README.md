# Lettres de Madame de Sévigné

As part of the final projects for classes on XML-TEI and XSLT, I encoded two letters from Pierre-Marie Gault-de-Saint-Germain's 1823 edition according to the principles of XML-TEI. To ensure harmony, I created an ODD adapted to the project, which also explores the possible uses of such an project, where it to be expanded to the entire corpus rather than two letters. 

Later, this TEI was the object of a transformation using XSLT into a series of html pages that interconnect.
